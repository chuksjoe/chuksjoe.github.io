# My Online Profile

My online profile is a project that was meant for a job interview test, but I felt what I did initially wasn't good enough. I had to devote more time to it, refined it and am still improving on it.
Most of all, am using it to finetune my programming and web design skills.

It is a project done with JQuery, HTML and CSS. It also features [Particles library](github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js)

My Profile includes the following sections:
- Intro: My Picture, Names, contact details and career objective.
- Skills: this contains both my technical skills and personal skills
- Education Quaification
- Work Experiences
- Career/Personal Projects
- Academic Projects
- Interests and Hobby
- Referees
- Gallery: this contains a slideshow of some of my pictures.
